# 1000-Step Survey Web App Implementation Plan

This repository contains a comprehensive, phased implementation plan for a modern Survey Web Application migrating from Excel to a web UI, built with:

- Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, SurveyJS
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, RLS, Storage, Realtime)
- Hosting: Vercel (frontend), Supabase managed services
- Future: Power BI integration hooks

Deliverables are organized into clear sections and phases with dependencies, acceptance criteria, and risk mitigations.

## How to Use

- Use sections 1–9 for context, architecture, security, testing, and rollout.
- Use the 10-1000-steps folder for granular, actionable tasks.
- Copy relevant code snippets into your project as you progress.

## Success Criteria (high level)

- Excel → web parity with improved UX and conditional logic.
- Real-time collaboration (view/edit presence, conflict resolution).
- Secure RLS with role-based access and audit logging.
- Import/export support (CSV/Excel/PDF).
- Deployed on Vercel + Supabase with CI/CD and monitoring.
